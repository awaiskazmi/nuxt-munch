    <h2>1 Customer Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      In order to provide our delivery service to our customers, Munchies uses
      various tools and systems to manage the delivery of orders. This includes
      tracking your deviceâ€™s location and GPS even if you are not interacting
      with the application directly, in order to assist you in finding the
      nearby hub and finding the route details from your current location.
    </p>
    <h2>Background Location</h2>
    <p>
      When your background location is turned on, Munchies collects and saves
      data even when the app is not being used directly. This is done in order
      to calculate the time our delivery riders spend online, and to ensure our
      customers and fleet managers can track the order progress and the
      allocation of riders accordingly. Tracking the location is also important
      for the delivery riders as it assists them in tracking their own orders.
