    <h2>1 Collection of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      When you use our Services, we may collect or receive Personal Information
      about you to provide our services and operate our business. The types of
      Personal Information that we may collect about you are:
    </p>
    <h5>a. Information You Provide to Us Directly</h5>
    <p>
      You may provide your Personal Information to us when you use our Services,
      including when you register with Munchies, search within or place orders
      through our Services, contact us with inquiries, respond to surveys, or
      otherwise access our Services. This information may include: User Profile

      and phone number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Order Details – When you place an order through our Services we collect
      information related to that order. This may include information such as
      items purchased, special instructions, date and time of order, and
      subtotal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Payment Information – Payment information collected such as payment
      method.
    </p>
    <p>

      participates, we may request certain Personal Information such as name and
      email address.
    </p>
    <h5>b. Information Received From You as Part of Your Communications</h5>
    <p>
      When you use our Services (for example on our App), complete electronic
      forms, communicate with Buddies or contact us,by email, phone or text, we
      may automatically collect and store certain information about you and the
      activity you engaged in, for example: your name and contact information;
      your order details; information that you voluntarily provide to us; the
      nature of your communication; the purpose of the interaction, and the
      action we took in response to your inquiry or request.
    </p>
    <h5>c. Information Collected Automatically</h5>
    <p>
      We also may receive and store certain information about you and your
      device(s) automatically when you access or use our App and Services. This
      information may include: Technical Information – We collect technical
      information associated with your activity on our Site and may include
      information related to your operating system, IP address (the Internet
      address of your computer) unique device identifiers, and other information
      such as your device type. We use such information for diagnostic and
      statistical purposes and to administer our Services.
    </p>
    <h5>d. Location Information</h5>
    <p>
      When you use the Services, we may collect and store general location
      information (such as IP address and GPS location). If you permit the
      Services to access location services through the permission system used by
      your mobile operating system (“Platform”) or browser, we may also collect
      and store the precise location of your device when the Munchies app is
      running in the foreground or background of your device. This information
      may be used to help you select your delivery address, to provide more
      accurate deliveries of your orders, to provide recommendations to you, and
      to enhance your user experience and improve the services. You can choose
      whether to enable the location tracking feature through the settings on
      your device or Platform or when prompted by the Munchies mobile app. If
      you choose to disable the location feature, the Buddy will not receive
      precise location information from your device, which may compromise the
      accuracy of deliveries in some situations, for instance, if you are
      located in a large area, such as a park.
    </p>
    <h5>
      e. Personal Information from Publicly Available Sources and Third Parties
    </h5>
    <p>
      We may collect or receive Personal Information about you from publicly
      available sources, social network providers, marketing partners, and/or
      third parties. This may include: Social Network Information – We may
      receive information about you from other services. For example, we receive
      certain information from Facebook when you use their service to login to
      Munchies. Demographic Information – This characteristic information could
      include information such as income, marital status, spending habits, and
      other information pertaining to customers.
    </p>
    <h2>2 Use of Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      We use cookies, pixels, session replay/screen capture, and similar
      technologies to collect information and personalize your experience with
      our Services. When we use session replay technology, we may collect on a
      real-time basis information on how you use and navigate the Services. This
      may include taps and how you scroll through the Services, but we do not
      collect keystroke data. Additional information on other technologies we
      may use is set forth below.
    </p>
    <h5>a. Online Analytics and Advertising Technologies</h5>
    <p>
      We and our third-party vendors may use automated technologies (including
      cookie identifiers on our Site), along with other collected information,
      to tailor ads or deliver content when you are on our Services or on other
      devices, apps or websites.
    </p>
    <h5>b. Interest-Based Advertising</h5>
    <p>
      We (or our service providers) may use the information we collect, for
      instance, IP addresses and unique mobile device identifiers, to locate or
      try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices
      (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers), or work with providers that
      do this, in order to better tailor content and features and provide you
      with a seamless experience across devices. If you wish to opt out of cross
      device tracking for purposes of interest-based advertising, you may do so
      through your device settings. We may also use cross-device targeting to
      help identify our users and serve advertising. This type of advertising is
      often called “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising—and when it
      occurs on mobile apps, “cross-app” advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out of
      receiving tailored advertising by visiting (i) the Network Advertising
      Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link or (ii) the Digital Advertising
      Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link. To opt out of Google Analytics for
      display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit
      the Google Ads Settings page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive advertisements
      from us. However, in that case, the advertising will not be tailored to
      your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or
      whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out
      programs.
    </p>
    <h5>c. Mobile Applications</h5>
    <p>
      Depending on your permissions, we may receive your Personal Information
      from your Internet service and mobile device providers. Users of mobile
      devices who do not want to receive interest-based advertising may opt-out
      in several ways. Learn more about your choices for mobile devices by
      visiting http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices. Each operating system, (iOS
      for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft
      devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of
      tailored in-application advertisements. You should view your device or
      system “Settings” to determine how you can opt out of use of your device
      ID for “cross-app” personalized advertising.
    </p>
    <h2>3 Use of Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      We may use the information we collect or receive about you for various
      purposes.
    </p>
    <h5>a. To Provide You With the Services</h5>
    <p>
      We use your information to provide you the Services. For example, we use
      credit card information to complete a transaction or an address to allow
      the Buddy to fulfill your delivery. If the applicable information is to be
      provided or Service is to be performed by a third party, then we will
      disclose the applicable Personal Information to the third party providing
      the information or performing applicable Services. Your information may be
      available or provided to third-party service providers and that are
      contractually obligated to protect your information as disclosed in this
      Policy.
    </p>
    <h5>b. To Maintain, Improve, and Personalize the Services</h5>
    <p>
      We use your information for our everyday business operations such as
      auditing, administration of the Services, forum management, fulfillment,
      and analytics. Your information may also be used to improve the content
      and/or functionality of the Services. We may use your information to help
      us improve offerings for Munchies and/or our Merchants. We also use your
      information to personalize your experience. For example, we may
      personalize the content and features you see when visiting our Services.
      In addition, we may personalize advertisements, marketing communications,
      and recommendations to make them more tailored to your interests.
    </p>
    <h5>c. To Communicate with You</h5>
    <p>
      We use your information to communicate with you. For example, we may send
      you text messages or other notifications about the status of your orders
      and deliveries. We may also contact you with promotional offerings or
      other communications that may be of interest to you. If we send you
      marketing emails about services that may interest you, each email will
      contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future email
      marketing communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event you contact us, we use certain information to respond to your
      questions and assist you with any issues that may arise in your use of the
      Services. If you send text messages to a Buddy, using the telephone number
      for that Buddy available on the Services, we may use a third-party service
      provider to track and analyze these text messages. We track these text
      messages for fraud prevention, to ensure appropriate charging of fees, to
      enforce our Terms and Conditions, and for quality and training purposes.
      As part of this process, Munchies and its service provider will receive in
      real time and store data about your text message, including the date and
      time of the text message, your phone number, and the content of the text
      message. You will not be able to opt out of transactional text messages
      between you and Buddies.
    </p>
    <h5>d. For Account and Network Security Purposes</h5>
    <p>
      We care about keeping you secure and safe while using our Services.
      Keeping you safe requires us to process your Personal Information, such as

      to monitor and verify your identity so that unauthorized users do not gain
      access to your information.
    </p>
    <h5>e. To Maintain Legal and Regulatory Compliance</h5>
    <p>

      Information to: investigate, prevent or mitigate violations of our
      internal terms, agreements or policies; enforce our agreements with third

      including, without limitation, using information for fraud prevention, for
